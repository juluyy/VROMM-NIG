               <p>Ferrari F40: Celebrating an Iconic Supercar

                The Ferrari F40, unveiled in 1987 to celebrate Ferrari's 40th anniversary, remains one of the most iconic supercars of all time. Designed by Pininfarina and powered by a 2.9-liter twin-turbocharged V8 engine, the F40 produces 478 horsepower, enabling it to accelerate from 0 to 100 km/h (0-62 mph) in just 4.1 seconds and reach a top speed of 324 km/h (201 mph).
                
                The F40's lightweight construction, featuring a carbon fiber, Kevlar, and aluminum body, combined with its aggressive aerodynamics, provided exceptional performance and handling. Its distinctive design, with a large rear wing and low, wide stance, has made the F40 a timeless classic.
                
                Inside, the F40 is all about pure driving pleasure, with a stripped-down interior focused on performance. Minimalist yet functional, the cockpit features racing seats, a simple instrument cluster, and little in the way of luxury, reflecting its status as a true driver's car.
